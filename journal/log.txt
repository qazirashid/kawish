2015-08-13 09:00 Jouranl will caputre the thoughts and progress as the project advances.
The jouranl contains tags which are prefixed with @ symbol. thus @kawish is a tag. It will allow us to search this journal entry by using the tag.

2015-08-13 09:00 we should start building @website.
A minimalist website that is useful but does not overwhelm.

2015-08-13 09:00 @task decide a @host for @website.
I have explored Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. Google Cloud seems cheaper. Discuss with @team to get their opinion.

2015-08-13 09:00 @task create a @skills @matrix for team.
Each team member who is willing to contribute will list his skills and the time he/she can spend.

2015-08-13 09:00 @task--- write a @blog discussing what is already there and what is missing that we will cover.

2015-08-13 18:28 Started Journal

2015-08-13 19:05 We need to encourage @team and set up @guidelines of them.
They cannot contribute because they don't know how to contribute.

2015-08-13 20:07 kawish: Today I @explored @webm video file format that is royality free and supported by @HTML5.
Although our @website will contain mostly links to videos on the video hosting websites, we should also host some videos, particularly the ones we create, on our @website as well. Thus is some vidoe hosting site is blocked, then our lesson videos should be accessible by alternative means.

2015-08-13 20:22 :

2015-08-13 20:23 : There are many intiatives similar to the one we want to undertake.
One @challenge is to collate the lesson @content that is already available and organize it into a structure.

2015-08-13 20:24 kawish: Aother @challenge is to deliver the @content to those who it.

2015-08-13 20:44 : khawarizmi science society KSS was pointed out as similar.
Alghought its youtube channel contains some video lessons from Maktab foundation, there are very few of these lesson which do not cover even half the syllabus. Website of KSS does not have any lessons and it seems that KSS is focussed more physics and higher education at university level. Their youtube channel videos mostly cover university courses.

2015-08-13 20:51 : maktab.org is a @similar @site to our aimed site.
It seems to have a lot of content organzised for 9th, 10th and FA/FSc students. Some of lessons are marked free but there are others that are marked private. I am not sure whether the private lessons are free or not. Anyway, this site certainly contains lots of video lesson that we should link to.

2015-08-13 20:59 : sabaq.pk has even more videos than maktab.
Matkab shows some videos that are taken from Sabaq. Moreover, all videos on sabaq.pk are free and can be watched without logging in. This is a really nice site and makes me question whether we really need to have our own site. Sabaq offers a full course DVD for different courses for RS 300. It seems a bit pricy but they do not charge anything for online viewing so I suppose their cost of producing DVDs must be hight. @abid has met the founder of sabaq and discussed with him. He has shown his willingness that the content of those lessons can be used freely by other sites, modified and redistributed.

2015-08-13 21:07 : @khan academy also has an initiative where its videos,
 which are originally in English, can be dubbed in other languages.

On @youtube we can find urdu version of Khan academy lessons. This also seems
a great initiative. it seems we have to do very little then.
Probably we should link to these lessons and then look in other directions, for example, other lessons formats.
One thing I have noticed is that all these lessons (Maktab, Sabaq, khan) are based on a @blackboard style of lesson.
This style is not bad but since this style of content is already avaialbe in most cases, why should we look at other syles
of lessons, for example, animated lessons. So I'll look at @animation as well.

2015-08-13 21:16 : @khan academy has a @youtube channel .
https://www.youtube.com/user/KhanAcademyUrdu/playlists that contains all lessons of khan acaedmy translated in urdu. They also contain subtitles. So I think khan academy has certainly seriously thought about provding content in other languages and has delivered it. What we perhaps need is to look at other forms of lesson or how to make lessons more engaging or interesting. or hopefully khan academy will do that too and we can focuson on distribution problem.

2015-08-14 22:19 : had a meeting with @Abid.
We discussed next steps for @website, mainly to decide layout, roles and functionality for each role. we thought some basics about @workflows. The we discussed @delivery. We thought of starting a @pilot project. We will build a set of DVDs and make it available to those who have very little access. The details are in mintues of meeting.

2015-08-17 18:36 I was thinking about the @organization of @website and was not sure how to do it.
The @organization of @class syllabus related lessons seems fairly decided already,
so there isn't much to do.

2015-08-17 18:44 We need database to store video meta data so that we can easily search videos according to many possible criteria.
If we organize course videos in the structure of
text-book-board --> class ---> subject ---> chapter
then it should be easy to search , say all videos for a given class. say  9th. or all videos for a subject, say Chemistry.

What would be more useful is that we store the videos in this file hierarchy and then put their meta data in a database.
The metadata should contain tags for each video that describe the content of video and its position in hierarchy.
Then we should use match the tags to seach for videos of interest.

2015-08-18 21:25 Today I looked at options for backend of kawish @website.
I think it is better to use a well know @PHP @framework instead of using some less known @python framework.
I'll ask @abid whether to use a @CMS or a @PHP framework.
CMS will not give us much flexibility but if needs our current requirements then why not use it.
We can build an alternate version slowly in a framework later on.

2015-08-20 19:11 I was watching some videos for @PHP @framework called @laravel.
It seems ok. 
Altough I personally would have liked python backend, PHP is not a bad choice
since other developer know it better and will develop more productively.

2016-05-18 08:40 Writing a log after a long time. The web site is online. it is static and is sufficient for our purpose. It is hosted for free by github.
